Due to their flexible architecture and inherent parallelism,FPGAs are ideal candidate for neural network implementations.
Still they have not achieved wide-spread acceptance in this regard. 
One of the major roadblock for FPGAs is the implementation of complex mathematical functions encountered in neural networks. 
Exact implementation of these functions consume large number of resources.In this paper we discuss the approximate implementation of a probabilistic neural networks (PNN) on Xilinx Ultrascale FPGAs.
The complex mathematical functions as replaced by approximations.
Analysis shows that hardware performance is much higher than that of software counter parts and the error induced due to approximation is within tolerance levels.
